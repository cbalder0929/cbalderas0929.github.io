<h1>404 Error : My Response</h1>

<p>When I first clicked on the link, I was caught off guard by the 404 announcement, I thought there was something not letting me access the page which was quite funny that I feel for it. I thought the graphic was quite interesting, but it didn't ring any immediate bells to be quite honest, I guess I'm too young to have experienced the golden age of the web as Kate describes it in the article.  The only thing I could say it resembled is what modern memes look like. Kate int the article goes very into dept into this idea I was just victim to in the sentence above how the internet is forever recycling itself.<p/>

<p> It was a bit harder to follow along with what she was saying because like I said I never had much experience with the internet as she did, I've spent my entirely in what is now the web 2.0. However, many of the feelings she shared I heavily agreed with. In the section titled 2010 Appquarius she wrote a sentence that mentioned how in the early life of the web you had to stumble upon websites and how you had to go look for sites that were useful to you. In that moment I started to think about when exactly I was introduced to the web. Hard to pinpoint but it had to have been when I was in 1st grade and it was going to be the first year they allowed my class into the computer lab, the teacher in the computer lab had us practicing our typing skills on some website all I can remember was it was underwater themed and the mascot was a purple octopus.<p/>

<p>But what she said sparked an interest. She told us that if we learned to type faster in the future we would potentially earn more in our careers. I remember going home and thinking about this nonstop and addiction was on the verge of sprouting. Across the street from mt grandmothers' hair salon was a computer lab where all the neighborhood kids would go, Youd pay a couple dollars and you'd get an hour of computer time from then on me and my cousins were in there almost daily. Mostly playing games I remember my favorite was the nickelodeon website which had games themed after all of my favorite shows. Eventually that place closed and for some years I had no access to a computer. The next time I had access to computers was in the 3rd grade. I remember the school had gotten a grant and wed all gotten new state of the art chrome books. It seemed like the world was moving so fast.<p/>

<p> On the Chromebook they had restrictions, so we were only allowed to use a reading site called Raz kids but even then I remember it being so much fun. Then she mentioned coolmath4kids which was able to bypass the restrictions because it had the word math in it what a breakthrough discovery at the time. During recess we had the option to play on the chrome books, some kids were really good on the computers, I remember one kid figured out how to temporarily change the numbers on the gradebook and bypass even more restriction which allowed to find even more fun games we all looked at him like a god. What a fun, time a little down the line I joined the boys and girls club in our neighborhood those computers had no restrictions and we would play the new game that had just released which at the time was ROBLOX. The way these games spread was always the same the tech savviest kid was always able to find the best games and theyd share the site with us and wed play together for hours on end.<p/>

<p> Going back on what Kate said about the web being much more exciting before the introduction of web 2.0 I can 100% agree. The sense of community we built and the teamwork we had to use to find new things to play was great and the web was a much better place to be in those times. Then around 2010 I remember everyone getting Ipods and getting on Facebook, it was much different you cared about what people thought of you what you posted and how many friends you had, even though we were not supposed to be on those apps at the time I do remember being on their and the web was just totally different and most definitely changed me and everyone I knew. <p/>
