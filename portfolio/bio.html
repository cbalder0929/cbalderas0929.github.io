		<p>This is me on a horse. I had to have been around 4 or 5 years old at the time. This was at a flea market in my neighborhood. Everyweekend my grandfather would bring me here and we would shop for groceries tools and other random fleamarket finds. From time to time the vendors would bring different animals and I always loved riding the horses. I always loved horses because in mexico owning a horse is sort of a status symbol, only the rich ranchman own horse and extra cool points if your horse knows how to dance.</p>
